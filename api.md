The API has three types of requests, seperated into different pages for clarity. When on the same network as the API server, these requests can be called directly from the URL bar in a browser or they can be embedded into another application.

- [Motor Requests](motor): Used to get or modify motor attributes such as position and torque
- [Multimotor Requests](multimotor): Used to run multiple motor requests in a single API call
- [Motion Requests](motion): Used to get information about or execute pre-programmed motions
