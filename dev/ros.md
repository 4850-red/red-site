# Robot Operating System

## Package Conversion

The packages available on the robot had to be updated to be compatible with ROS2.

### Build System Change
In the conversion from ROS1 to ROS2, the build system had to be changed from cmake to colcon.

### Dependency Changes
Names of dependencies also had to be changed.

### Broken Code
Minor code changes needed to be made for renaming things or fixing broken code in the serial package.

## Implementation
