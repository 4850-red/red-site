# Research

A lot of research had to be done so that we could document the technical specifications of the robot that were neded for development.

## Motor Ranges

To document the motor ranges, we created a web app to select motors and control them with a slider, similar to what is in the app. We went through all of the motors and wrote down the minimum, maximum, and default position values for all of them, which are shown below.

| Motor ID | Motion | Minimum | Default | Maximum | Notes |
0 | Left foot tilt | 127 | 115 | 140 | Inwards to outwards
1 | Right foot tilt | 127 | 110 | 140 | Outwards to inwards
2 | Left foot | 127 | 77 | 175 | Down to up
3 | Right foot | 127 | 78 | 175 | Up to down
4 | Left knee | 204 | 77 | 204 | Backwards to forwards
5 | Right knee | 50 | 50 | 180 | Forwards to backwards
6 | Left leg kick | 127 |  |  | Forwards to backwards
7 | Right leg kick | 127 |  |  | Backwards to forwards
8 | Left leg outward | 127 |  |  | Inwards to outwards
9 | Right leg outward | 127 |  |  | Outwards to inwards
10 | Left leg rotate | 127 |  |  | Outwards to inwards
11 | Right leg rotate | 127 |  |  | Inwards to outwards
12 | Left arm rotate hole | 180 | 10 | 254 | 10 is straight up
13 | Right arm rotate whole | 180 | 1 | 254 | 254 is straight up
14 | Left arm rotate out | 115 | 1 | 120 | 115 is up
15 | Right arm rotate out | 138 | 130 | 254 | 254 is up
16 | Left arm rotate in | 120 | 1 | 254 |
17 | Right arm rotate in | 128 | 1 | 254 |
18 | Left elbow | 48 | 48 | 190 | 190 is up
19 | Right elbow | 210 | 65 | 210 | 210 is up
22 | Hip rotate | 127 | 90 | 170 | 127 is right
23 | Head yaw |  |  |  |
24 | Head pitch |  | 70 | 160 |
