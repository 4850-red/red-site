# Project Plan

## Overview
The project plan was provided as a template given to us by professor Perry, both to help to keep us organized and so that she can make sure that we are on track.
The project plan covered the following:

- Final deliverables
- Milestones
- Meeting schedule
- Gantt chart
- Risk assessment
- Test plan

This provided a good foundation for our group that we stuck to throughout the project, which a couple of small adjustments being made where needed.
