# REST API

## Server
The REST API server was built using with Node.js and Express.js.
- Node.js: open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
- Express.js (Express): back-end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js

These 2 existing environments and frameworks are standard and widely used for web applications. They fit the perfect for an API server to communicate to the robot wirelessly over a network, or even potentially the internet.

## ROS Integration

In order for the API server to perform robot actions, there needs to be a connection to ROS. It’s possible to communicate by sending messages over rose nodes. There is an existing Node.js package called ‘rclnodejs’ (https://www.npmjs.com/package/rclnodejs) that eases this process.
