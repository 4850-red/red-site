# Presentation

## Overview
Because our group was accepted to C-Day, we had to condense the massive amount of information we have collected into a poster and a three minute video presentation.
Our approach was to emphasize our reasoning behind the project and leaving out some of the issues that we ran into.

## Poster
We wanted our poster to be simple, so we chose a design that is not text heavy.
We added a QR code to our website with our documentation which can be accessed for anyone who wants to read more.
The idea is that the poster is just to supplement the very hands-on presentation we are doing in person.

## Video presentation
The video presentation had to be condensed a lot as well to fit everything into the time constraints given.
Again, we opted to go light on reading material and instead took advantage of the video format to narrate the important information and show the rest through pictures and videos.
