# Training
By the request of our advisor Professor Sharon Perry, this team designed and implemented a training certification for other teams using the UXA-90 robots. This team certfied the members of other teams in the following areas:
- Proper Handling
- Setup and Basic Operation
- Safety Mitigation Steps


### Robot Documentation
For transparency and for current/future teams' use, the documentation for the training program is publicly hosted on [Github](https://4850-robots.github.io/robot_documentation/).
