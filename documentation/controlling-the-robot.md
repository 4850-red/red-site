# Controlling the Robot

When operating the robot, always make sure you are in a clear area and that someone is holding the tether. The remote controller button guide is located in Appendix 7 of the operation manual.

## Preparing to walk
1. Toggle the power switch on the remote
2. Press the init button to switch the robot into the basic init position
3. Press the basic button to switch the robot in to the basic walking posture

Always call out commands before pressing the button on the remote. When done, go into init position, then sitdown position and continue with the turn off sequence.
